# 🎓 SmartScholr – A Machine Learning–Powered Personalized Learning Assistant

> 🚀 A capstone project blending Machine Learning with optional Generative AI to create a smart education assistant that predicts performance, detects weaknesses, and builds personalized study plans for students.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

**SmartScholr** is an intelligent educational platform designed to support students in their academic journey. At its core, the system uses **machine learning** to:

- Predict student performance
- Identify students at risk of failure or dropout
- Deliver concept-wise assessments
- Recommend tailored study plans
- Track progress over time

To make learning more interactive and personalized, the system optionally includes a **GenAI chatbot** trained on academic content to answer student queries and explain difficult concepts.

## 🎯 Objectives

- 📈 Predict student performance using academic history
- ⚠️ Identify at-risk learners using classification models
- 🧪 Auto-generate and score quizzes
- 📉 Detect weak topics based on assessment results
- 🗓️ Recommend personalized study plans
- 💬 Provide AI-powered concept explanations 
- 📊 Track learning progress and show improvements
